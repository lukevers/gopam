# gopam

Originally from [krockot/gopam](https://github.com/krockot/gopam), this didn't compile and I was trying to get it to compile. It compiles now! As of it's current state, I haven't even looked at how gopam does what it does, so I have no clue if it's correctly implemented or not. If it's not, don't shoot the compiler-er!

Original README file below:

It's Go!  It's PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)!  It's GoPAM!

This is a Go wrapper for the PAM application API.  There's not much
else to be said.  PAM is a simple API and now it's available for use in Go
applications.

There's an example of a "fake login" program in the examples
directory.  Look at the pam module's godocs for details about the Go
API; for a more general PAM application API reference, peep

In the future, maybe the module API will be wrapped too.  I don't know!
